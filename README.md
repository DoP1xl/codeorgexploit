# codeorgexploit
repository - attempting to exploit and break out of the code.org project sandbox

# breaking the sandbox
> code.org allows for certain things such as logging to a console and opening dev tools shows you a log from the console where you can change the data the console sent instead of the original log to allow for an alert or whatever you want to execute - our goal is to find a way to execute code without user interaction with dev tools etc.

# methods
- method 1: console logging
- method 2: image url grabbing
- method 3: opening a url
